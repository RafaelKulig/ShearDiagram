# Shear Diagram
This is a project that aims to bring together basic tools for stress-strain analysis calculations for engineering purposes

## Libraries
- matplotlib

## Updates
- Added a new function to calculate and plot shear force for a simple beam with two supports and one point load. Force on x-axis are taken as zero. A future update will allow to include multiple point loads in diffent angles.
